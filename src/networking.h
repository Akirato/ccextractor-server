/** Reads data block from descriptor. 
 *
 * Blocks have following format:
 * -# Command -- 1 byte
 * -# Lenght -- INT_LEN (ie 10) bytes
 * -# Data -- Lenght bytes
 * -# \\r\\n -- 2 bytes
 *
 * Command is defined protocol constant, representing block's data type
 *
 * Lenght is a string with decimal number representing data size in bytes.
 * Lenght can be 0, then no data would be read and \p buf_len would be set to 0.
 * If lenght is greater than 0, buf specified buffer is NULL or 0-size, then 
 * BLK_SIZE error is returned. If buffer size is smaller than block size,
 * \p buf_size would be read, other bytes would be ignored and warning message 
 * would be printed to logs.
 * 
 * If read_block didn't find "\\r\\n" bytes at the end, then END_MARKER error is
 * returned.
 *
 * If readn call inside this function can't read specied number of bytes, then
 * read_block returns 0. This can happen if client closed connection or specifed
 * descriptor is in non-blocking mode. If readn ends with error, read_block 
 * returns ERRNO constans, meaning that error value is hold in errno variable.
 *
 * To get error string corresponding to returned values, m_strerror should be called.
 *
 * @param fd file or socket descriptor to read from
 * @param command 1 byte, representing block's data type
 * @param buf data buffer of buf_len size. It can be NULL if block Lenght is
 * expected to be 0. 
 * @param buf_len before call it should contain size of data buffer (\p buf).
 * After su—Åcessful completion it shall contain a number of bytes read into
 * data buffer (\p buf)
 * @return On succcess, number of bytes read in whole block is returned.\n
 * Returns 0, if it can't read specified number of bytes from decriptor 
 * (eg. client closed connection).\n
 * Otherwise, returns negative value, represinting error.
